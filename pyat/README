Installation (Linux only)
-------------------------

All the binaries should be built when building the  Python extension.

It is easiest to do this using a virtualenv:

* virtualenv --no-site-packages venv
* source venv/bin/activate
* pip install numpy
* pip install pytest
* python setup.py build
* python setup.py install --prefix=prefix

This should build the extension into the subdirectory prefix.

Now you need to set up the PYTHONPATH:

* export PYTHONPATH=./prefix/lib/python2.7/site-packages:.

Finally, you should be able to run the tests:

* py.test test
